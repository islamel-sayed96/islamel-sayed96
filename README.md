Hello there ! I’m Islam El-sayed , I’m a Full Stack Developer Using .NET Graduated from Information Technology Institute (ITI)

From my background in programming I have gained valuable and transferrable skills such as knowledge of design principles, attention to detail, organization, aesthetic sensibility, communication and problem-solving skills. I consider myself a fast learner, a team player, a curious and a disciplined person.

My current goal is to keep growing and gaining experience as a Full Stack .NET Developer. What I am most passionate about web development is that I can easily see the results of my work impacting other people's lives. I look forward to finding creative solutions to new challenges.
